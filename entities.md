ObjectBox Specification for Auto Ninja

Overview

ObjectBox will replace SQLite as the primary database for storing raw data in Auto Ninja, while Qdrant continues to handle vectorized summaries for fast context retrieval. ObjectBox will manage the following entities:

-   Interaction: Represents a single user-agent interaction (e.g., a prompt and response).

-   Agent: Represents an agent with a name and role (e.g., "John the Math Tutor").

-   Skill: Represents a reusable skill that agents can acquire (e.g., "Algebra Teaching").

-   Tool: Represents a reusable tool that agents can use (e.g., "Calculator").

ObjectBox's object-oriented design allows us to define these entities as Python classes with annotations, supporting dynamic schema changes, native relationships, and high performance for CRUD operations.

ObjectBox Setup

-   Dependency: Add objectbox to requirements.txt.

-   Storage Location: ObjectBox stores data in a local directory (e.g., ./objectbox_data), ensuring a local-first, privacy-focused design.

-   Initialization: Initialize ObjectBox with a model definition that includes all entities and their relationships.

Entities and Relationships

We'll define each entity as a Python class with ObjectBox annotations (@Entity, @Id, @Property, etc.), specifying fields, relationships, and constraints. ObjectBox uses these classes to manage data storage and retrieval.

Entity: Interaction

    -   timestamp: Datetime (NOT NULL)

        -   When the interaction occurred, required for ordering and auditing.

    -   user_prompt: String (NOT NULL, DEFAULT "")

        -   The user's input, required but can be an empty string if the user provides no input.

    -   actual_output: String (NOT NULL)

      "updated_at": null,
      "metadata": { "type": "digital" }
    }
    ```

Relationships in ObjectBox

ObjectBox natively supports relationships using ToOne and ToMany relations, which are more intuitive than SQLite's junction tables or TinyDB's manual ID management:

-   Interaction → Agent: Each Interaction has a ToOne relation to an Agent (via agent_id).

-   Interaction → Interaction: Each Interaction has a ToOne relation to its parent Interaction (via parent_id in metadata), enabling conversation threading.

-   Agent → Skill: Each Agent has a ToMany relation to Skill, representing the many-to-many relationship between agents and skills.

-   Agent → Tool: Each Agent has a ToMany relation to Tool, representing the many-to-many relationship between agents and tools.

-   Skill → Agent: ObjectBox automatically manages the inverse relation (ToMany from Skill to Agent), though we won't use this directly.

-   Tool → Agent: Similarly, ObjectBox manages the inverse relation (ToMany from Tool to Agent).

Hybrid Memory Structure with ObjectBox

-   Raw Data (ObjectBox):

    -   Store Interaction, Agent, Skill, and Tool objects in ObjectBox.

    -   Use ObjectBox's object-oriented storage to manage data and relationships directly (e.g., interaction.agent to access the associated agent).

-   Vectorized Summaries (Qdrant):

    -   Continue using Qdrant for vectorized summaries of interactions, storing the ObjectBox id in Qdrant metadata for linking back to raw data.

    -   Example Qdrant metadata:

        json

        ```
        {
          "id": 1,
          "agent_id": 1,
          "category": "weather",
          "parent_id": null,
          "cluster_id": "weather_1"
        }
        ```

    -   Future Consideration: Explore ObjectBox Vector Search to potentially replace Qdrant, consolidating the hybrid memory structure into a single database.

Workflow for Agent Creation with Skills and Tools

1.  Prompt User:

    -   On app startup, prompt the user to create an agent via POST /agent/create:

        -   Request: {"name": "John", "role": "Math Tutor"}

        -   Response: {"agent_id": 1, "name": "John", "role": "Math Tutor"}

2.  Store Agent in ObjectBox:

    -   Create a new Agent object with the provided name and role.

    -   Set created_at to the current timestamp.

    -   Initially set role_info, updated_at, metadata, skills, and tools to null or empty lists.

3.  Query Grok for Role Information:

    -   Query Grok: "How can an AI agent become a Math Tutor? Provide knowledge, skills, and tools needed."

    -   Grok Response: {"knowledge": "Proficiency in algebra...", "skills": ["Algebra Teaching", "Problem Solving"], "tools": ["Calculator"]}

    -   Store the response in role_info.

4.  Create or Link Skills and Tools:

    -   For each skill in role_info.skills:

        -   Check if the skill exists in ObjectBox (e.g., by name).

        -   If not, create a new Skill object with Grok's instructions (if available).

        -   Add the skill to the agent's skills ToMany relation.

    -   For each tool in role_info.tools:

        -   Check if the tool exists in ObjectBox.

        -   If not, create a new Tool object with Grok's instructions (if available).

        -   Add the tool to the agent's tools ToMany relation.

5.  Handle Offline Case:

    -   If Grok is unavailable, leave role_info as null and defer skill/tool creation until online.

Benefits of Using ObjectBox

1.  Schema Flexibility:

    -   ObjectBox allows dynamic schema changes without migrations. Adding a new field (e.g., feedback to Interaction) requires only updating the object model, and ObjectBox handles the rest.

2.  Performance:

    -   ObjectBox is optimized for edge devices, offering faster CRUD operations than SQLite and TinyDB, especially for writes (e.g., storing interactions) and reads (e.g., retrieving context).

3.  Relationships:

    -   Native ToOne and ToMany relations simplify the many-to-many relationships between agents, skills, and tools, eliminating the need for junction tables (unlike SQLite) or manual ID management (unlike TinyDB).

4.  Local-First Design:

    -   ObjectBox is lightweight, embedded, and requires no server, aligning with Auto Ninja's privacy-focused design.

5.  Future-Proofing:

    -   ObjectBox's support for data synchronization (ObjectBox Sync) and vector search (ObjectBox Vector Search) provides options for future features like cross-device syncing or replacing Qdrant.

Challenges and Mitigations

-   Learning Curve:

    -   ObjectBox's object-oriented API requires learning its annotations and conventions (e.g., @Entity, @Id, ToMany). However, its Python API is well-documented and straightforward.

    -   Mitigation: Start with a small subset of entities (e.g., Interaction and Agent) and gradually add Skill and Tool as needed.

-   Dependencies:

    -   ObjectBox requires adding its library (objectbox), but the overhead is minimal (~1MB).

    -   Mitigation: Ensure the dependency is well-documented in requirements.txt and tested for compatibility.

-   Vector Search:

    -   ObjectBox Vector Search is a potential replacement for Qdrant, but it's less mature than Qdrant for vector similarity search. For now, continue using Qdrant, and evaluate ObjectBox Vector Search in the future.

    -   Mitigation: Keep the hybrid structure (ObjectBox + Qdrant) until ObjectBox Vector Search is proven to meet Auto Ninja's needs.

Future Enhancements

-   Skill and Tool Evolution:

    -   Add fields like proficiency and usage_frequency to the skills and tools ToMany relations in Agent (ObjectBox supports relation-specific properties) to track agent development.

-   Multimodal Data:

    -   Extend Interaction to include fields like image_id or audio_id for multimodal data, leveraging ObjectBox's schema flexibility.

-   Data Synchronization:

    -   Explore ObjectBox Sync for cross-device synchronization if Auto Ninja needs to sync data between devices (e.g., a user's phone and laptop).

* * * * *

Recommendation for Auto Ninja

1.  Adopt ObjectBox for Raw Data Storage:

    -   Use the ObjectBox specification above to define Interaction, Agent, Skill, and Tool entities with their fields and relationships.

    -   Store raw data in ObjectBox, leveraging its object-oriented design, performance, and schema flexibility.

2.  Continue Using Qdrant for Vectorized Summaries:

    -   Store vectorized summaries of interactions in Qdrant, linking back to ObjectBox via the id field.

    -   Future Consideration: Evaluate ObjectBox Vector Search as a potential replacement for Qdrant to consolidate the hybrid memory structure.

3.  Implement Agent Creation with Skills and Tools:

    -   Add a /agent/create endpoint to prompt for name and role, create the Agent object, query Grok, and link skills/tools using ToMany relations.

    -   Handle offline cases by leaving role_info as null and deferring skill/tool creation until online.

This specification ensures Auto Ninja's memory system is flexible, performant, and ready for future evolution, while supporting the agent creation process and shared library of skills and tools. Let me know if you'd like to refine this further or move on to the next topic, such as multimodal payloads!

Let's create a detailed specification for Qdrant to manage the vectorized summaries in Auto Ninja's hybrid memory structure, complementing the ObjectBox specification we've already defined. Qdrant will handle the fast, topic-based retrieval of interaction summaries, enabling context-aware responses by leveraging vector similarity search and clustering. This specification will define the collections, data structure, metadata, relationships, and workflows for Qdrant, ensuring it integrates seamlessly with ObjectBox (which stores the raw data) and supports Auto Ninja's requirements for quick referencing, conversation threading, and topic-based relationships.

* * * * *

Qdrant Specification for Auto Ninja

Overview

Qdrant is a vector search engine designed for high-dimensional vector similarity search, making it ideal for storing and retrieving vectorized summaries of interactions in Auto Ninja. It complements ObjectBox, which stores the raw data (interactions, agents, skills, and tools), by providing fast, topic-based retrieval for context-aware responses. Qdrant will store vector embeddings of summarized interactions, along with metadata to link back to ObjectBox records, categorize interactions, and support conversation threading and topic clustering.

Qdrant Setup

-   Dependency: Add qdrant-client to requirements.txt.

-   Storage Location: Qdrant will run as an embedded instance on the local device, storing data in a directory (e.g., ./qdrant_data), ensuring a local-first, privacy-focused design.

-   Initialization: Initialize Qdrant with a collection for interaction summaries, configuring the vector size and distance metric for similarity search.

Collection: interaction_summaries

Qdrant organizes data into collections, where each collection contains points (data entries) with vector embeddings and associated metadata. We'll create a single collection, interaction_summaries, to store vectorized summaries of interactions.

-   Vector Configuration:

    -   Vector Size: 384 (using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 sentence transformer, which generates 384-dimensional embeddings).

    -   Distance Metric: Cosine similarity (suitable for text embeddings, as it measures the angle between vectors, normalizing for magnitude).

    -   Indexing: Use HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) indexing for efficient similarity search, which Qdrant supports by default.

-   Point Structure: Each point in the interaction_summaries collection represents a summarized interaction and includes:

    -   ID: Integer (matches the id of the corresponding Interaction in ObjectBox).

    -   Vector: List of Floats (384-dimensional embedding of the summary).

    -   Payload: Dictionary (metadata for linking, categorization, and relationships).

-   Fields in Payload:

    -   id: Integer (NOT NULL)

        -   The ObjectBox id of the corresponding Interaction, used to link back to the raw data.

    -   agent_id: Integer (NOT NULL)

        -   The ObjectBox agent_id of the associated Agent, enabling agent-specific context retrieval.

    -   timestamp: String (NOT NULL)

        -   The timestamp of the interaction (e.g., "2025-03-29T10:00:00"), used for ordering and filtering.

    -   summary: String (NOT NULL)

        -   A concise summary of the interaction (e.g., "User: Hello, how is the weather at your data center? | Agent: Stable, 22°C, typical humidity").

    -   category: String (NOT NULL, DEFAULT "general")

        -   The topic/category of the interaction (e.g., "weather"), used for filtering during retrieval.

    -   parent_id: Integer (NULLABLE)

        -   The ObjectBox id of the parent interaction, enabling conversation threading.

    -   cluster_id: String (NULLABLE)

        -   The ID of the cluster this interaction belongs to (e.g., "weather_1"), used for topic-based grouping.

    -   metadata: Dictionary (NULLABLE)

        -   Additional metadata (e.g., user ID, session ID, tags).

-   Constraints:

    -   id, agent_id, timestamp, summary, and category are required (non-nullable) to ensure each point has the core data needed for retrieval and linking.

    -   parent_id, cluster_id, and metadata are nullable to handle cases where data is unavailable (e.g., first interaction in a thread, clustering not yet performed).

Example Points in interaction_summaries

-   Point 1:

    -   ID: 1

    -   Vector: [0.12, -0.34, ..., 0.56] (384-dimensional embedding)

    -   Payload:

        json

        ```
        {
          "id": 1,
          "agent_id": 1,
          "timestamp": "2025-03-29T10:00:00",
          "summary": "User: Hello, how is the weather at your data center? | Agent: Stable, 22°C, typical humidity.",
          "category": "weather",
          "parent_id": null,
          "cluster_id": "weather_1",
          "metadata": { "user_id": "user123", "session_id": "session456" }
        }
        ```

-   Point 2 (Follow-Up Interaction):

    -   ID: 2

          "id": 2,
          "agent_id": 1,
          "timestamp": "2025-03-29T10:01:00",
          "summary": "User: Can you please convert to Fahrenheit? I am not familiar with Celsius. | Agent: Of course! The temperature at the data center, which was 22°C, converts to 71.6°F. Does that help?",
          "category": "weather",
          "parent_id": 1,
          "cluster_id": "weather_1",
          "metadata": { "user_id": "user123", "session_id": "session456" }
        }
        ```

-   Point 3 (Empty Prompt):

    -   ID: 3

    -   Vector: [0.08, -0.19, ..., 0.45] (384-dimensional embedding)

    -   Payload:

        json

        ```
        {
          "id": 3,
          "agent_id": 1,
          "timestamp": "2025-03-29T10:02:00",
          "summary": "User: [No prompt provided] | Agent: I'm sorry, I didn't receive a prompt. Could you please provide more details?",
          "category": "general",
          "parent_id": 2,
          "cluster_id": null,
          "metadata": { "user_id": "user123", "session_id": "session456" }
        }
        ```

Relationships in Qdrant

Qdrant doesn't natively support relationships like ObjectBox (e.g., ToOne, ToMany), but we can represent relationships using metadata fields:

-   Interaction → Agent: The agent_id field links each summary to its associated agent, allowing agent-specific context retrieval (e.g., retrieve summaries for agent_id: 1).

-   Interaction → Interaction: The parent_id field links each summary to its parent interaction, enabling conversation threading (e.g., ID 2 → ID 1).

-   Topic-Based Relationships: The cluster_id field groups summaries into clusters (e.g., "weather_1"), enabling topic-based retrieval without explicitly storing related_ids.

Clustering for Topic-Based Relationships

To support topic-based referencing without the overhead of related_ids, we'll use Qdrant's vector similarity search and periodic clustering:

-   Similarity Search:

    -   During inference, search Qdrant for the top 3 most similar summaries to the current user prompt, filtering by category (e.g., category: "weather").

    -   Example: For a prompt "What's the humidity like?", search for similar summaries in the "weather" category, retrieving IDs 1 and 2.

-   Clustering:

    -   Periodically (e.g., nightly) cluster the embeddings in Qdrant using a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-means) to group similar summaries into topics.

    -   Assign a cluster_id to each point (e.g., "weather_1" for weather-related summaries).

    -   Example: Cluster IDs 1 and 2 into "weather_1", allowing retrieval of all weather-related summaries with a single filter (cluster_id: "weather_1").

-   Implementation:

    -   Use a library like scikit-learn to perform K-means clustering on the embeddings.

    -   Update the cluster_id field in Qdrant for each point after clustering.

Workflow for Storing and Retrieving Summaries

On Interaction

1.  Store Raw Interaction in ObjectBox:

    -   Create an Interaction object with fields (id, agent, timestamp, user_prompt, actual_output, target_output, metadata).

    -   Set the parent relation based on metadata.parent_id.

    -   Store the object in ObjectBox, obtaining the id.

2.  Summarize the Interaction:

    -   Generate a summary string:

        -   If user_prompt is not empty: "User: {user_prompt} | Agent: {target_output or actual_output}".

        -   If user_prompt is empty: "User: [No prompt provided] | Agent: {target_output or actual_output}".

    -   Example: "User: Hello, how is the weather at your data center? | Agent: Stable, 22°C, typical humidity."

3.  Assign a Category:

    -   Use a keyword-based approach to assign a category:

        -   If the summary contains "weather", "temperature", or "humidity", set category: "weather".

        -   Otherwise, set category: "general".

    -   Future Enhancement: Use Grok to assign categories (e.g., "Classify this interaction: weather, coding, or general?").

4.  Generate Vector Embedding:

    -   Use a sentence transformer (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to generate a 384-dimensional embedding of the summary.

    -   Example: [0.12, -0.34, ..., 0.56].

5.  Store in Qdrant:

    -   Create a point in the interaction_summaries collection with:

        -   ID: ObjectBox id (e.g., 1).

        -   Vector: The 384-dimensional embedding.

        -   Payload: Metadata including id, agent_id, timestamp, summary, category, parent_id, and metadata.

    -   Example:

        json

        ```
        {
          "id": 1,
          "agent_id": 1,
          "timestamp": "2025-03-29T10:00:00",
          "summary": "User: Hello, how is the weather at your data center? | Agent: Stable, 22°C, typical humidity.",
          "category": "weather",
          "parent_id": null,
          "cluster_id": null,
          "metadata": { "user_id": "user123", "session_id": "session456" }
        }
        ```

6.  Cluster Periodically:

    -   Run a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-means) on all embeddings in Qdrant nightly.

    -   Assign a cluster_id to each point (e.g., "weather_1" for weather-related summaries).

    -   Update the cluster_id field in Qdrant for each point.

On Inference (Quick Reference)

1.  Generate Vector for Current Prompt:

    -   For a new prompt (e.g., "What's the humidity like?"), generate a 384-dimensional embedding using the same sentence transformer.

2.  Search Qdrant:

    -   Search the interaction_summaries collection for the top 3 most similar summaries, filtering by category (e.g., category: "weather") and optionally cluster_id (e.g., cluster_id: "weather_1").

    -   Example: Retrieve summaries for IDs 1 and 2 (weather-related interactions).

3.  Use Summaries for Context:

    -   Use the summaries directly for quick context (e.g., "Recent weather discussion: Stable, 22°C, typical humidity.").

On Inference (Deep Context)

1.  Retrieve ObjectBox IDs:

    -   From the Qdrant search results, extract the id fields (e.g., IDs 1 and 2).

2.  Follow Conversation Thread:

    -   For each ID, retrieve the parent_id from the payload and recursively fetch parent summaries to reconstruct the thread (e.g., ID 2 → ID 1).

3.  Query ObjectBox:

    -   Use the id values to query ObjectBox for the full Interaction objects (e.g., IDs 1 and 2).

    -   Retrieve the raw user_prompt, actual_output, and target_output for detailed context.

4.  Use Context for Inference:

    -   Pass the raw data to the local model or Grok for a context-aware response.

Benefits of Using Qdrant

1.  Fast Similarity Search:

    -   Qdrant's vector search engine enables rapid retrieval of similar summaries, supporting quick, topic-based referencing (e.g., retrieving all "weather" interactions in milliseconds).

2.  Topic-Based Clustering:

    -   Clustering with cluster_id allows the agent to group related interactions dynamically (e.g., "weather_1" for weather-related summaries), reducing the need for explicit related_ids and minimizing resource usage.

3.  Category Filtering:

    -   The category field enables efficient filtering during retrieval (e.g., category: "weather"), improving the relevance of context without scanning all summaries.

4.  Local-First Design:

    -   Qdrant can run as an embedded instance on the local device, ensuring privacy by keeping all data on-device.

5.  Extensibility:

    -   The metadata field in the payload can be extended to include additional data (e.g., tags, multimodal metadata) as Auto Ninja evolves.

Challenges and Mitigations

-   Embedding Quality:

    -   The effectiveness of Qdrant's similarity search depends on the quality of embeddings. The all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model is lightweight but may miss nuances in complex prompts.

    -   Mitigation: Test alternative embedding models (e.g., all-mpnet-base-v2 for better accuracy, though larger at 768 dimensions) and fine-tune the similarity threshold (e.g., cosine similarity > 0.8).

-   Clustering Overhead:

    -   Periodic clustering (e.g., nightly) adds computational overhead, especially as the number of interactions grows.

    -   Mitigation: Run clustering during low-traffic periods (e.g., midnight) and optimize by clustering incrementally (only new points since the last run).

-   Resource Usage:

    -   Qdrant's memory usage grows with the number of vectors, which could strain low-end devices.

    -   Mitigation: Use a lightweight embedding model (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2), prune old interactions (e.g., older than 6 months), and monitor memory usage.

-   Data Consistency:

    -   Ensure consistency between ObjectBox and Qdrant (e.g., if an interaction is deleted in ObjectBox, remove its summary from Qdrant).

    -   Mitigation: Implement a cleanup process to sync ObjectBox and Qdrant periodically (e.g., nightly).

Future Enhancements

-   Advanced Categorization:

    -   Use Grok to assign categories dynamically (e.g., "Classify this interaction: weather, coding, or general?") for more accurate topic tagging.

-   Hierarchical Clustering:

    -   Implement hierarchical clustering in Qdrant (e.g., "weather > data center weather") for more granular topic retrieval.

-   Multimodal Summaries:

    -   Extend Qdrant to store embeddings of multimodal data (e.g., vision summaries like "User described a kitchen with a red kettle") as Auto Ninja supports more tasks.

-   Replace Qdrant with ObjectBox Vector Search:

    -   Evaluate ObjectBox Vector Search as a potential replacement for Qdrant, consolidating the hybrid memory structure into a single database for simplicity.

Recommendation for Auto Ninja

1.  Adopt Qdrant for Vectorized Summaries:

    -   Use the Qdrant specification above to create the interaction_summaries collection with vector embeddings, payloads, and metadata.

    -   Configure Qdrant with a 384-dimensional vector size, cosine similarity, and HNSW indexing for efficient search.

2.  Integrate with ObjectBox:

    -   Store raw data in ObjectBox and vectorized summaries in Qdrant, linking them via the id field.

    -   Ensure consistency between ObjectBox and Qdrant by syncing data during writes and periodic cleanups.

3.  Implement Clustering for Topic Relationships:

    -   Use Qdrant's similarity search and periodic clustering to group interactions by topic (e.g., "weather_1"), enabling fast, topic-based retrieval without related_ids.

4.  Handle Edge Cases:

    -   Ensure summaries for empty prompts (user_prompt: "") are meaningful (e.g., "User: [No prompt provided] | Agent: ...") to maintain search quality.

    -   Prune old summaries to manage resource usage on low-end devices.

This Qdrant specification ensures Auto Ninja's hybrid memory structure is efficient, scalable, and ready for future multimodal support, while providing fast, topic-based retrieval for context-aware responses.
